If you do not know **Elliot**, you are not aware of the number of possibilities that you are wasting when it comes to perform your pentestings. A new all-in-one hacking framework is going to be unleashed... or is it just a product of your imagination?

üñ•Ô∏è Installation
---
To install the tool, the easiest way is to use the `go get` command:

```go
go get github.com/cosasdepuma/elliot
```

You can also download the precompiles binary for your system in the [**Release**](https://github.com/CosasDePuma/Elliot/releases) tab.

üêã Dockerize
---
You can execute the application in containerized environments like Docker. To download the image, just run:

```sh
docker pull cosasdepuma/elliot:latest
```

The recommended way to run the image is:

```
docker run --rm -it cosasdepuma/elliot
```

üî© Develop
---
You can develop your own modules or contribute to the development and improvements of the project freely.

The first thing you need to do is clone the project using the `git` tool:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cosasdepuma/Elliot
```

Once downloaded, do not hesitate to modify everything you think necessary.

You should take a look at the [TODO](./TODO.md) and [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) files to get an idea of what needs to be done.

üîß Compile
---

Compiling Elliot is extremely easy. Just run the command:

```go
go build -o elliot main.go
```

You can also specify both the operating system and the target architecture:

```go
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o elliot.exe main.go
```

You can automate the compilation process using the script found inside the **scripts** folder called `x-build`. It supports the following os/arch:

| Supported x32 | Supported x64 |
| --- | --- |
| windows/386 | windows/am64 |
| linux/386 | linux/amd64 |
| darwin/386 | darwin/amd64 |
| freebsd/386 | freebsd/amd64 |

üêô Support the developer!

Everything I do and publish can be used for free whenever I receive my corresponding merit.
